# ButtonBox

## Aim

The aim of this device was to have something that I can easily use to interface with other small projects that I'm building. Specifically, I purchased this [Servo Robot Arm](https://ls.codetech.nl/shops/346407/files/420569260/otronic-robot-arm-exclusief-servomotors.jpg) which I had no way to directly control. 

At its core, a ButtonBox (or 'Job Agnostic Button Box', as it's full title is), is a collection of input and output devices all hooked up to a single microcontroller. The microcontroller has some standard libraries and functions for operating those inputs and outputs, and is easily accessible for extending its software. Connecting the box to other devices can be done via common connectors such as USB or jack plugs. 

## Inspiration

During the build I was deeply inspired by the done manifesto, especially 'perfection is boring, it stops you from getting it done'.

## For those who are interested in building their own

Down below I'll describe in more detail what this specific box is made of, but in reality these details don't matter too much. The important idea is that you have convenient input, output, and extensibiltiy.
